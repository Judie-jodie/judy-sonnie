# Phase-3-project
### OVERVIEW

The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) wants to improve the safety of the city's roads and reduce the severity of injuries and fatalities resulting from car crashes. To do so, they need to identify the most important factors that contribute to the severity of injuries and fatalities. By analyzing data from past car crashes, they aim to uncover patterns and trends in the data that can help them make data-driven decisions and recommendations to improve road safety. The ultimate goal is to develop targeted interventions that can reduce the number and severity of car crashes in the city.

### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING AND DATA UNDERSTANDING

The objective is to identify strategies that can help reduce the occurrence of fatal car accidents in Chicago. By analyzing data available on the Chicago Data Portal, I aim to identify the critical factors that contribute to fatal car crashes and provide actionable recommendations to the Chicago Department of Transportation.

### DATA AND METHODOLOGY

I used two datasets for our analysis: "Crashes" which provides details on each crash incident, and "People" which provides details on each individual involved in each crash.

To create my target variable, I added a "TARGET" column based on the type of injury incurred by each person involved in the crash
I visualized some predictors to see how the affect the injurry incurred


### FINDINGS
I found that the sex that is male got into more fatal and incapacitating accidents more than females and that usage of safety equipments like Helmets and safety belts played  major role in accidents and the injuries to be incurred

### MODEL
 I used dummy classifier and the confusion matrix as my metrics
 
 ### RECCOMENDATIONS
 
 public education on use of saftey gears is important so the department should try and educate the people on so.
